Some site updates:

1. Moved everything out of Contentful and Pocket to being pulled from local Markdown files. I've started moving everything I read/write to local file systems, whenver possible, so it made sense to move this too.
2. Some new colors, and some font tweaks. It was too white and I much prefer [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato) over [Barlow](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Barlow?query=barlow) and felt the site could use some serifs in the titles.

I probably broke some stuff too, so if you see something, say something.
