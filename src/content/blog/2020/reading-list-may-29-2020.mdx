description: Interesting things from the week of May 29, 2020.
---

I split my mornings between reading a book or combing through my RSS feeds. This week skewed more heavily towards reading a book ([How to Do Nothing](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781612197494)), but I did find a few things that avoided my “read later” list.

[Daring Fireball: ‘What Time Is It in London?’](https://daringfireball.net/2020/05/what_time_is_it_in_london)

> So every other service that tries to answer “What time is it in London?” gets it right. Only Siri gets it wrong.

[If I could bring one thing back to the internet it would be blogs](http://tttthis.com/blog/if-i-could-bring-one-thing-back-to-the-internet-it-would-be-blogs?ref=thismodernweb.com)

[Opinion | What if We All Vacationed at Home Again? - The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/23/opinion/sunday/coronavirus-travel-summer-vacation.html?action=click&module=Opinion&pgtype=Homepage)

> At the end of last year, [an Ipsos Mori poll](https://www.ipsos.com/ipsos-mori/en-uk/what-worries-world-june-2019) found that 79 percent of British people believe that their country is “on the wrong track” — a sentiment echoed [in countries around the world](https://www.ipsos.com/ipsos-mori/en-uk/majority-across-25-countries-say-their-country-wrong-track) . Much of this can be attributed to the attenuation of opportunity that followed the financial crisis of 2008-09. But some of it stems from a lost sense of belonging and the gulf that has emerged between those who still cling to the liberal dream of heterogeneity and those hankering for a more parochial past.

> The fact that so many of us now spend our moments of maximum happiness overseas has surely played a role in deepening this fault line. And many of the pleasurable experiences of social intermingling that might once have offered a counterbalance, like a day out at the seaside, have been sacrificed to consumer choice.

[netlifycms](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/intro/)

I moved the content side of this site to markdown, but wanted an easier way to update content than making markdown files, commiting and pushing them, so I added Netlify CMS to the site. It's a little rough around the edges still, but for what I was trying to do it hits 100% of the features.

[increment](https://increment.com)

I have a soft-spot for magazines, when I was re-learning how to program I had two days a week where I would kill some time in the day flipping through the coding related magazines at Microcenter. This issue is all about frontend development so its extra relevant to me but the past issues look pretty good too.
