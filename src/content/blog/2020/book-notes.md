Updating some book entries with interesting quotes from them. Probably my favorite this year:

> Traveling across America, they were astonished at how deeply violence is embedded in our culture, how it has _become_ the culture, what’s left of local color. We are a grisly nation.

My favorite book so far this year has been [How to Do Nothing](/books/how-to-do-nothing). I captured some things from there, but I recommend reading the whole thing, if you can.

[My Year of Meats](/books/my-year-of-meats)
[How to Do Nothing](/books/how-to-do-nothing)
[Smarter Faster Better](/books/smarter-faster-better)
[Big Magic](/books/big-magic)
[The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up](/books/the-life-changing-magic-of-tidying-up)
