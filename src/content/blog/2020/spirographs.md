We were cleaning out toys this weekend and found a gear drawing set for making spirographs. A family member bought it for my daughter to take on a flight when she was younger, but she was _too_ young to enjoy it at the time. We had more fun with it this week, and finally got around to using [these Zebra pens](https://www.zebrapen.com/product/sarasa-clip-gel-retractable/?source=brand) I had.

But, the programmer in me said, “hey, sometimes the gear skips, what if we did it in code”, and made this.

The colors are random, have fun reloading / changing the variables.
