“Thanks” to the Coronavirus for keeping me in my house, I made it through four of these. Of them, _The Last of Us Part II_ had the best story, _Hades_ is the best video game, in that it is fun and has great mechanics, and art, and sound. _Ghost of Tsushima_ was a fun open world game, but wouldn’t make a Playstation 4 top ten for me. _Final Fantasy VII_ remake likely would make a top ten list, but I’d hesitate to recommend it to people who hadn’t played the original.
