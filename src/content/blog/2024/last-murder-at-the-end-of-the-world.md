The last two books I read ([Supercommunicators](/blog/2024/supercommunicators/) and [You Only Die Once](/blog/2024/you-only-die-once/)) were non-fiction, but I usually have a fiction and non-fiction book going at the same time. This was my most recent fiction one.

I read [The 7 1/2 Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36337550-the-7-deaths-of-evelyn-hardcastle), also by Stuart Turton, back in 2021. Plot wise they both work the same way: a bit of exposition, a dramatic reveal, and then a little puzzle that you don’t have enough pieces to understand to put everything together. The doling out of new information happens frequently enough and the books are short enough that you go along with the building mystery until the end. Basically, if you enjoy mysteries with a little bit of a sci-fi or gothic horror twist, you'd probably like either of them.

_The Last Murder at the End of the World_ feels like it has some thematic overlap with [Horizon Zero Dawn](https://www.guerrilla-games.com/games), to the point where if I found out Stuart Turton had never played the game I’d honestly be shocked. This isn’t fan fiction by any means, but while reading the book I kept picturing the world of HZD. Considering I really enjoy the HZD series, that’s not a bad thing! And if you like HZD, maybe you’d like this book too!
