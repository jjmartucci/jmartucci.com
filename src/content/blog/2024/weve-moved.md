For quite a while now I’ve had both this site (jmartucci.com) and [Built with Coffee](https://builtwith.coffee). This domain has for years been a simple redirect to Built With Coffee, but I decide to split to two into two different things. Why?
- The codebase of [Built with Coffee](https://builtwith.coffee) had the refuse of about 8 different framework and CMS implementations, plus what can only be described as a “crap-ton” of weird little React components.
- Mixing a blog with a statement of who I am professionally felt weird, maybe more so this year after writing things like [this](https://jmartucci.com/blog/2024/doom-or-the-market-for-web-developers-in-2024/) and [this](https://jmartucci.com/blog/2023-gets-an-a/).
- The new structure of this site overlaps with a 🤫 side project I’ve been working on.
- Ideally with everything cleaned up I’ll actually start writing more.
