## Ingredients
- 1 tablespoon canola oil
- ½ cup chopped onion
- 1 ¼ cups sugar 
- ½ cup water
- ¼ cup port wine
- ¼ teaspoon ground ginger
- 1 (12-ounce) package fresh cranberries
- 2 teaspoons grated orange rind

## Directions
1. Heat oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. 
2. Add onion, and sauté for 4 minutes.
3. Add sugar and the next 4 ingredients (through cranberries); bring to a boil. 
4. Reduce heat, and simmer until cranberries pop and reach desired texture[^1].
5. Remove from heat, and stir in orange rind. Serve chilled or at room temperature.

## Notes
[^1]: The original recipe called for simmering for 8 minutes, in my experience it takes more like 30 - 40 minutes.
