I saw “You Only Die Once” at the local bookstore[^1], and being one to judge books by their covers and interior illustrations, it seemed fun. It acknowledges some overlap with [4000 Weeks - Time Management for Mortals](https://www.oliverburkeman.com/books) by Oliver Burkeman, but with more humor and less philosophy. Also, there’s worksheets and questionaires to fill out, if those are things you find helpful. Overall, Jodi Wellman would like you to live this life:

The book begins with an explanation of the phrase [momento mori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_mori), and uses it as a touchpoint throughout. As someone who studied Latin at a Catholic High School this was not a new idea to me, but if you need the TL;DR, it’s this: never forget that you’re a skeleton wrapped in meat, sitting on a planet that could be vaporized by [space plasma jets](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/sep/18/huge-plasma-jets-spotted-gigantic-black-hole-porphyrion) at any time, in a universe that will eventually cease to exist. And uh, that’s ok! That’s the point of life. Do what you will with this new knowledge.

I’d recommend either this book or 4000 Weeks (favoring this one only if you enjoy worksheets and cartoons of skulls) but if you hate reading and just want to know how much time you have left, here’s a handy calculator:

<script src="/scripts/weeks-left.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
<style>
    input {
        font-family: var(--sans-serif);
        border: 0;
        border-bottom: 1px solid currentColor;
    }
    input[type="number"] {
        max-width: 3rem;
    }
</style>
<weeks-left />
