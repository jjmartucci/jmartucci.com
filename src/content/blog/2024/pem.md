School has been out this week due to a teacher’s strike so I figured I’d do something mildly educational and took Lorelei over to the [Peabody Essex Museum](https://www.pem.org). I’d, somehow, never been, although Lorelei has. It’s quite nice, and a good size, and they had a guitar on display so that’s cool.

We saw most of the main exhibits, did some arts and crafts, then went over to the excellent [Essex Pizza](https://essexsnypizza.com) across the street for a cheeseburger pizza.
