> The unique tragedy with Twitter’s changing attitude toward developers is that so many of Twitter’s early innovations did come from third-party developers. The word tweet, the first use of a bird icon, and even the character counter started in Twitterrific. Twitter’s new leadership displayed an incredible disrespect for the value developers added to both the ecosystem and core platform.

From the Leaving Twitter chapter of Manton Reece's [Indie Microblogging](https://book.micro.blog/leaving-twitter/). Just a reminder that political and leadership changes aside, most of the joy of early Twitter died years ago.
