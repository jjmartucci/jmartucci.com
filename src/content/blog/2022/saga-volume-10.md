Took Lorelei to the comic book store yesterday. She got some Pokemon cards, I got Saga, volume 10. I’ve been waiting for it for a while, volume 9 released in 2018! And ended on a total gut punch too. Fortunately this one has a happier ending.

Yeah, it’s another rough one. Still a great series. I want to believe there’s a happy (happy enough) ending for Hazel but that looks to be many volumes away still.
