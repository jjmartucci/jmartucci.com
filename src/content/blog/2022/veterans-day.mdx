![My Grandfather in his fabulously cluttered shed.](https://coffee-cake.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/2022/grandpa.jpeg)

I wrote about my [Grandfather’s experience in World War II a few years ago](https://www.builtwith.coffee/blog-posts/2018/11/veterans-day?searchterm=veteran). We talked for hours about a few significant days in his life, but at the time it was hard to find any information about it online. Well I searched again this year and found this, [a substantial write-up about the Battle of Metz and Fort Driant](https://warfarehistorynetwork.com/article/battle-of-metz-pattons-bloody-fortress-battle/).

This paragraph describes the main conflict my grandfather saw in the war and described to me in detail:

> Irwin broke off the attack the following day and replaced elements of his battered 11th Infantry with fresh troops from his 2nd and 10th Regiments; the two units renewed the assault on October 7. This time, the Americans attempted to fight their way into the underground entrances to the fort but made no better progress; they soon were bogged down.

Also interesting:

> The 26th Division alone reported 3,000 cases of trench foot during the November offensive, Patton said.

Which was what eventually sent my Grandfather back to America.
