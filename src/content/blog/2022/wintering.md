Some ice, and some snow.
![][image-1]![][image-2]

It occurred to me, watching Lorelei try to ice skate, how absurdly hard it is to learn unless you’re out on the ice _all the time_, and even then it’s such an odd activity. Here’s some tiny stilts that make you go much faster, unless your legs get a little bit further apart in which case you’ll fall directly on your head on the hardest thing we could find that wasn’t a rock.

On the topic of skates, I ordered some for myself. While we don’t skate often I figure at this point my feet are this size until I die, so why not get some decent skates. Fate has decided this is a Winter 2022 — 2023 goal for me instead.

It’s fine. I’ll go slip on the front walk and hit my head on that instead.
