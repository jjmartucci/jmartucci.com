We were out at lunch the other day and after burning through all the games on the front of the kids menu, Lorelei turned the menu over and started Tic-Tac-Toe on the back. Andrea suggested Hangman instead, and started explaining how you play it. It occurred to me that Hangman is… well kind of awful, so I suggested instead of Hangman we play DOOMCAT. Which is drawing a cat: two ears, two eyes, two pairs of whiskers, two teeth and then the DOOMCAT eats you. Which is also a little morbid but at least avoids antiquated forms of capital punishment.

We ran out of paper and then we ran out of food and left. Lorelei mentioned she liked and I thought, well, what if I just made it for you to play whenever. 

So… I made [DOOMCAT](https://doomcat.builtwith.coffee).

Some fun things:
- The cat emojis came from [OpenMoji](https://openmoji.org). They’re well set up for slicing for simple animations like this.
- Rather than set up a new project I made the entire thing in [Code Sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) then exported it to Github. From there I added it as a project in Netlify and made the custom domain a subdomain of this site which, as far as I can tell, worked and didn’t break anything.
- The GIF above was made with [Gifski](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gifski/id1351639930?mt=12).
