> This country, they say, is dull and greedy and always misses the point. The possibility of a new type of ecstatic vision and a life filled with meaningful tasks, I imagine, is what drew me and so many other readers to “Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance.” We believed Pirsig could see the Buddha in a well-maintained carburetor. We wanted to see it, too, and we wanted to work as he did, perhaps in large part because we saw very little future for ourselves in the striving world.

From [Returning, Again, to Robert M. Pirsig](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/returning-again-to-robert-m-pirsig). I keep meaning to reread _Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance_,  mainly because even if I don’t love the book, it has lots of great little lessons and themes that resonate. I reference [Pirsig’s Brick](https://www.thestrategyexchange.co.uk/2014/05/pirsigs-brick/) quite often.
