Two things I worked on this weekend:

1. I cleaned up _all_ the crap on this site from it being a developer playground over the years. Multiple frameworks, 3+ CMSs, metadata from various and sundry file managers, unused APIs, image optimization code that never worked and was making 100s of additional images every time I built, etc. Now everything is done “[the Next way](https://nextjs.org)”, including images, because I finally took the time to set up `next/image` using [Next on Netlify](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/common-configurations/next-js/). I cleaned up a bunch of components and the typography, so hopefully everything reads better.
2. For Christmas this year we proposed the East Coast and West Coast families get together for a “paint (by numbers) night”. We ordered the paint kits for everyone, then forgot about it, then scheduled the time, but then people were busy, then we _finally_ scheduled the time, and last night we did it.

Some people were a bit ambitious in their choices and might be occupied by this project until Christmas 2022. 8.5″ x 11″ is a good size. Excited to add this to the rotating art wall behind my on Zoom calls.
