[Jim Lill](https://www.youtube.com/user/JimLill45) has a lot of great videos breaking down what makes a difference in guitar sound. This one might be the best because the guitar market for amplifiers (along with guitar pedals) has had this mix of classic collectors claiming only one amp can get one tone, and deep-state conspiracy theorists arguing one wire makes all the difference (but don’t _look_ at the wire, opening the amp will change everything).

Turns out... nothing matters much except in what order the EQ and gain is added. So yes, a Fender _does_ sound different than a Marshall. Unless you want them to sound the same. And no, your Soviet-era tubes don’t radiate magic sound waves into your signal.
