Warm days in early Spring used to be my favorite time to ride as a kid. Warm enough you go in shorts and a shirt, but you can goof around on icy patches and catch those cool breezes off all the semi-frozen streams and ponds.

Today… wasn’t as great. Too much coffee and not enough breakfast and amazingly, even though these woods aren’t big, the trails were littered with enough dead leaves and dropped trees I got lost once, or twice, or thrice. But still — some goofin’ on the ice.
