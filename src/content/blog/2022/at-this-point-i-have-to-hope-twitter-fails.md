At this point I have to hope Twitter fails because if it’s successful a lot of other CEOs are going to wonder if they can cut half their staff and force people back to offices.

If I had to guess, in a year from now it’ll still be around, but some incredibly pared down version of it’s former self that still lives at twitter.com but isn’t recognizable as anything you’d think of as Twitter. I mean Myspace isn’t even completely dead yet.
