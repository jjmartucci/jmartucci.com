I finished [The Three-Body Problem](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780765382030) this morning. I’ve been reading it in stops and starts, I found many parts too tell-not-show for my tastes. It’s an interesting sci-fi plot with a graduate-level physics class thrown in the middle. Or it’s not sci-fi at all and it’s an allegory for Communist China’s interactions with the West. 

Either way it’s book number one of a three book series and I don’t think I’ll continue. I tend to stay away from books that are part of a series that can’t stand on their own. I’m two books into [The Stormlight Archive](https://www.goodreads.com/series/49075-the-stormlight-archive) but I’m not interested enough to keep going. Similarly I finished [Horizon Forbidden West](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/horizon-forbidden-west/) recently, a sequel itself that sets the story up for a trilogy and — I dunno, I’m not that interested in hearing more, especially if it’s tens or hundreds of hours more.

On sort of the other side of this, we watched _[Coda](https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/coda/umc.cmc.3eh9r5iz32ggdm4ccvw5igiir)_ last night. It’s as good as everyone said it was and I don’t think anyone is going to pitch an incredibly ironically titled _Coda 2_ about Ruby in college. In this era of “more of everything” it’s nice to enjoy something that ends.
