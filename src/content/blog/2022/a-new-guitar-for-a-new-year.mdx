[I wrote in 2020 about fixing up my first guitar](https://www.builtwith.coffee/blog-posts/2020/08/the-20-year-history-of-a-partscaster?searchterm=partscaster), a black Squire Stratocaster. It is (I think) from 1995. My other guitar is a nicer Stratocaster from 1999. When I got that guitar I was torn between it and something more “shreddy”. If I remember correctly I was comparing it to an Ibanez JS1000, but in the end I wanted the bridge and middle single coils, so I went with the Strat.

Well, 20-odd years later, I finally have a “shreddy” guitar, a the amazingly named [Charvel Pro-Mod San Dimas Style 1 HH FR M](https://charvel.com/gear/series/pro-mod/pro-mod-san-dimas-style-1-hh-fr-m/2975031500). I picked it up from [Matt’s Music Center](https://mattsmusic.com) in Weymouth, worth a trip if you’re in the Boston area looking for guitars. The color is Chameleon and I wanted to get it from a physical store, not online, because the color… photographs as a lot of different colors!

Like, it’s black, right?

Or purple?

Or kind of gold?

It’s fun and I’ve aggressively abused the whammy bar many times already. Now for next year finally following up on something I meant to _this year_, recording myself while playing.
