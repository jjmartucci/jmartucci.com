I like blogs where people add little cartoons and drawings to the text, which makes me think I should do it more. This one does it, and is a good read: [How to Beat Worry](https://moretothat.com/how-to-beat-worry/).

> The last thing a worrier should do is wait around for something to happen. Anticipation doesnâ€™t bode well for someone caught in a worry feedback loop, so the key is to proactively invest thought into a worthwhile challenge instead.
