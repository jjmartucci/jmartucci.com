I recommend [Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software](https://www.microsoftpressstore.com/store/code-the-hidden-language-of-computer-hardware-and-software-9780735611313) as a great history of _how_ we got to our current world of computers and programming. If you want the < 30 minute version, [Netflix’s Explained: Coding](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11167964/) is pretty good too.
