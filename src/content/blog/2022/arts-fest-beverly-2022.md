Took a walk down to [Arts Fest Beverly](https://www.bevmain.org/arts-fest-beverly/) early this morning. Nice weather for a walk, and it seemed like a lot of other people agreed, it was quite crowded. We picked up some prints for the house, and Lorelei went a bit cat crazy:

The walk was great not only because of the weather, but because there wasn’t many cars out because the bridge we take into town is [closed forever](https://baystatelocal.com/2022/06/16/hall-whitaker-bridge-to-permanently-close-friday-replacement-bridge-could-take-over-2-years-news/).

This bridge has always had an appearance of “should we be driving over this?” so the news of its closure was not surprising, but the one day of notice was.
