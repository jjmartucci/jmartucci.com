I’m going to start treating links as content and not as a separate thing living under [links](/links). I started thinking about this by way of [Stat’s Page](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2022/stats-page/) on Jim Nielsen’s blog, which led me to [Indexing My Blog’s Links](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2020/indexing-my-blogs-links/), which got me thinking that all the inline links I post get lost in posts over time, and the posts I created as "link" type posts were... not numerous. There’s a lot of things I read which are interesting, and it’s a disservice to the Internet (alright… it’s a disservice to me when I go to look these things up again) to not treat them as the rest of the content.

So, I updated [the links page](/links) to show all the external links ever posted here, and I’ll try to get better about re-sharing the good stuff I find. And I’ll remember to share links with the whole link title instead of some clever words because that might be clever but it is _not_ helpful.
