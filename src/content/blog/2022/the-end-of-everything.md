Finished [The End of Everything][1] this morning. Here’s a fun quote from the epilogue to chew over:

> If the universe is going to end, one way or another, I concede that we may as well make our peace with it. Pedro Ferreira is way ahead of me on that one. “I think it’s great,” he says. “It’s so simple and so clean.”
> 
> “I’ve never understood why people get so depressed about the end, the death of the Sun and all,” he continues, “I just like the serenity of it.”
> 
> “So it doesn’t bother you that we ultimately have no legacy in the universe?” I ask him.
> 
> “No, not at all,” he says. “I very much like our blip-ness… It’s always appealed to me,” he continues. “It’s the transience of these things. It’s the doing. It’s the process. It’s the journey. Who cares where you get to, right?”
