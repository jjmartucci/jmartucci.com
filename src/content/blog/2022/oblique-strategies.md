At some point I [found a webpage][1] that had an entire list of [Brian Eno’s Oblique Strategies][2]. I put it in a Bear note but that doesn’t quite capture the “I just need a new way of thinking aspect” of it, so I put the list on a page, and it grabs one from the list at random.

Please enjoy [an Oblique Strategy][3].

And if you’re like “uhhhh what”… just reload the page!
