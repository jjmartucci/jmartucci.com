I wish I could post the sound for this photo. Well I can, I guess? There was no sound. You get out early enough here and there’s no other bikers, no road noise, heck even the birds seemed like they’d had their worms and were chilling. 

This didn’t help the voice in my head that kept wondering why the trail was named Black Bear. It’s just a fun name… right?
