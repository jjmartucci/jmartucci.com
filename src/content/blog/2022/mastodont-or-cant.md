description: Trying to find a new Mastodon instance, just like everybody else.
---
I had a Mastodon account on [mastodon.technology](https://mastodon.technology/about) from a while back (April 2017 my account says — looking for an alternative to Twitter in late 2016 sounds right). Unfortunately the instance is shutting down. I looked about for a new one tonight and a _lot_ of them are already full, waitlist only. Which lead me into self-hosting, but the managed instance service I found, [masto.host is also temporarily unavailable](https://masto.host/pricing/).

Seems like a lot of people looking for a Twitter replacement real quick. Might do some more reading this weekend on the [Digital Ocean 1-click install option](https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2019/04/mastodon-now-available-on-digitalocean/).
