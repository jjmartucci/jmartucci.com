All the smart stuff in the house is back. I did two things:

- The older Apple TV in the basement was showing up as a home hub in Homekit. That might be fine but itâ€™s the oldest device of the available home hubs so I turned off the option for it to be a hub.
- Restarted the router. Which with an eero meansâ€¦ pushing one button in the app.

 So now my home automation can run, and at sunset today the Christmas tree will turn on and the nearby Homepod will start playing Christmas music. ðŸŽ„
