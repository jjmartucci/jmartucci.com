From [I wish my web server were in the corner of my room](https://interconnected.org/home/2022/10/10/servers). I enjoyed the [Hacker News discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33165836) on this, lots of early 2000 throwbacks about hosting some stupid script on a laptop plugged into a university network, but also some good options if you wanted to serve something from home in the year 2022.

Do you? Probably not, but I do miss thinking of a server as a thing that I can physically know and not some amorphous cloud entity.
