description: On “beating” modern games.

I played two games recently: [Death’s Door][1] and [The Forgotten City][2], both on the Playstation 5. Both were good (Death’s Door I’d even say great), but one thing they have in common that I don’t love about modern video games is the notion that the story is over, but wait, there’s more! More quests, or endings, or collectibles, or twists on playing the game you just played but slightly differently.

I kind of liked old video games where there was an end, and you could say you beat it, or, more likely with some [Nintendo-hard][3] games, didn’t.
