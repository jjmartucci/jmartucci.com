Finished [_Hench_ by Natalie Zina Walschots](https://bookshop.org/p/books/hench-natalie-zina-walschots/14843591?ean=9780062978585&next=t) today. The premise of the book is that superheroes and supervillains exist, and there’s an entire ecosystem of employees who need to support them. For the villains it’s henches handling business operations and meat handling… well getting punched or blown up, mostly.

The story follows Anna, a hench who through a series of unfortunate events, starts to really dislike how superheroes are perceived in the world, and comes up with an idea to bring them down to Earth.

Overall I enjoyed it, although I didn’t realize that while it is a complete narrative arc it sets itself up for a sequel. Reminded me a bit of [Vicious by V. E. Schwab](https://bookshop.org/p/books/vicious-v-e-schwab/7278358?ean=9781250183507&next=t) and [A Master of Djinn by P. Djèlí Clark](https://bookshop.org/p/books/a-master-of-djinn-p-djeli-clark/15126050?ean=9781250267665&next=t). I’ve  [said in the past that splitting books into a series is not my favorite way to handle narratives](/blog/2022/three-body-problem.md) but I think this book is enjoyable enough on its own.
