  Almost every year this time of year I pick up some “cozy games”, which
  generally means indie games that aren’t overly mentally taxing, have a good
  story, have a good gameplay loop, and have an “end” or an “I’ve enjoyed this
  enough” experience that you can hit in a few hours. The kid of thing you could
  finish between Christmas and New Years.

Almost every year this time of year I pick up some “cozy games”, which generally means indie games that aren’t overly mentally taxing, have a good story, have a good gameplay loop, and have an “end” or an “I’ve enjoyed this enough” experience that you can hit in a few hours. The kid of thing you could finish between Christmas and New Years.

Here’s an incomplete list of games that have fallen into this bucket, if you’re looking for something to finish out the year. Everything links to Steam but they're pretty widely available. 🌟 = ones I really enjoyed.

## Metroidvanias

Games where you explore, power up, and explore some more.
