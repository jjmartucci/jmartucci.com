From a [Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/9rmqzp/texans_say_voting_machines_are_flipping/) on Texas voting machines. This is a pretty egregious failure on the part of some UI developer somewhere, but it does speak to an often overlooked part of UI development: if a user can see an interface, they're going to try to interact with it, and it's your job to make sure that they can. If you don't have a good understand of what interactive means (or what can block it), Phillip Walton's recent post, ["Idle Until Urgent"](https://philipwalton.com/articles/idle-until-urgent/) is a good read.
