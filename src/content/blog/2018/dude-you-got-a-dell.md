About a year ago I was ready for a new computer.

I had money set aside to buy one, and was just waiting for the release of the new Macbook Pros. And then they released it... and I didn't get one. I had a number of older Macbook Pros that I üíñ, and when I had them you couldn‚Äôt convince me to ever use a Windows laptop instead. But in the years that passed since the last owning a MBP, a few things happened on the Windows side:

- Windows 10 released, and while I have issues with it, it‚Äôs the best release of Windows so far.
- I‚Äôm more OS agnostic than I used to be. I use a Windows PC for development at work, and there are no apps that I have a strong preference[^1] for that exist only on MacOS.

...and a few things happened on the Mac side. The last MBP I had was a 2012 model and it was great for the following reasons:

- It had an SD card reader! That was amazing at the time, and made importing photos off of my DSLR so much easier.
- It had an ethernet port.
- I had an Nvidia GPU in it, which made you believe Apple actually cared about gaming.
- You could upgrade it. It came with 4GB of RAM and a 250 GB spinny-disk and left my possession with 8GB and a sweet SSD.
- I bought it from Microcenter for under $1000. Actually, well under at $899, brand new.

So Apple decided to get rid of all of the things I liked, and focus on things I didn't care that much about, like making the computer incredibly light and adding a useless touchbar, while increasing the price.

So instead of a Macbook, I am now the ‚Äúproud‚Äù owner of a refurbished Dell Inspiron 7577.

Pros:

- It has a GTX1060 (MaxQ) GPU in it. It can play Overwatch at 60 FPS on high settings without breaking a sweat. Attempting to do that on a Macbook Pro would have required setting large piles of money on fire on something like an external Thunderbolt GPU box and dual booting Windows.
- It has an SD card reader! And an ethernet port! And an HDMI port! And a Thunderbolt port so I can attach a dock and get an entire second set of all of those ports!
- It has one screw that keeps the bottom on, and if you take it off, you can upgrade / replace whatever you want in there.
- I picked up a refurbished[^2] model and it cost about 50% less than a similar refurbished Macbook Pro would have cost.

Cons:

- The screen isn't great. I‚Äôll conceed that Apple‚Äôs retina screens are pretty amazing.
- It weighs about 3 times what a MBP would weigh, but again, I didn't need it to be super portable.
- I‚Äôve never used a Windows laptop trackpad that was half as nice to use as a Mac‚Äôs, although I will say that this one is better, and has multitouch support.

It‚Äôs worth noting here that I have an iPad Pro that I‚Äôm pretty enamoured with, and it was a driver for not needing a laptop running MacOS. 95% of what I used MacOS for exists on iOS, and the iPad is lighter, cheaper, and (in some cases) faster than a MacOS running laptop. If the two OSs ever merged, I‚Äôd consider getting a Mac laptop again, but until then I‚Äôm happy with Mac apps running on an Arm processor and everything running on a much cheaper Intel box.

<span id="fn-1"><a href="#fnref-1">1</a></span> I will admit that there's no good Windows replacement for Tweetbot, and not being able to use Sketch is _annoying_, but I am equally annoyed that they won't support Windows. And my favorite writing app, iA Writer, has [a kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/reichenstein/a-focused-writing-app-for-windows) for a Windows version!

<span id="fn-2"><a href="#fnref-2">2</a></span> I try to buy refurbished computers and electronics whenever possible. Best case, they're just a computer someone returned, worst case they failed in some way and then got fixed, but that just means someone else took the early part of the [bathtub curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bathtub_curve) for you. Also, some times you get unexpected free upgrades.
