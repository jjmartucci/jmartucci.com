description: Dude you had a Dell.

The very first blog post on this blog is about [why I decided to get a Dell instead of a new Macbook Pro](https://www.builtwith.coffee/blog-posts/2018/02/dude-you-got-a-dell). I’m glad to see the new M1 Pro/Max fixes everything. I already bought an M1 Air but someday this touchbar/butterfly workbox will get replaced with one of these, so there’s that to look foward to.

Also, that Dell I went with was fine. I ended up getting rid of it because I don’t game on PC any more. You’d still be better off with any Dell with a dedicated GPU than a Mac for gaming, even if it will pull down 400 watts of power to run.
