### Get in the pit

Went to a concert for the first time since COVID. The show was [Crazy & The Brains](https://crazyandthebrains.net) (first punk band I’ve seen use a xylophone), [Bridge City Sinners](https://www.bridgecitysinners.com), better explained in their own words:

And [Days N Daze](https://daysndaze.net), short one member, but made up for with some mouth trumpet and backup from the previous bands.

Two notes:
- I think this was the biggest crowd I’ve been around since the last show I saw at the Middle East, in January of 2020. Go big or go home, I guess.
- I adore that no one in Cambridge cares about other people _at all_. It’s already pretty on-brand for New Englanders to ignore other people, but when a person in a skull mask, leather jacket with studs, and a kilt can walk around with no one saying anything, that’s perfect.

And shoutout to Dan for getting the tickets and convincing me to leave the house. We both acknowledged it’s a lot harder these days.

### Professional
An iPhone 13 Pro showed up this week. I wasn’t planning on upgrading my XR (it was fine), but the AT&T trade-in for a decent amount of money only to be mind-controlled by them for the rest of your life[^1] was hard to pass up. Also, the number of cameras. My XR was definitely lacking in [Fuck Everything, We’re Doing Five Blades](https://www.theonion.com/fuck-everything-were-doing-five-blades-1819584036) energy.

So far that camera has been great for taking pictures of my child who finds the most adorable faces to make.

### etc
Just posting this for posterity, so some day my kid can find this and know that I was good at video games (some times, when other people are bad).
