A minor change this week, I’m going from bullet points to headers. This week was either chill, or I forgot to write down a bunch of stuff.

### Hurricane more like Hurrican’te
Lorelei was supposed to spend the week with her grandparents, but since they live in Connecticut <s>hurricane</s> tropical storm Henri threw a wrench in the works. It looks like this might all blow over (pun intended) and she’ll get down there later this week.

### Arts Fest Beverly
We either missed (or intentionally ignored) the arts fest in town in 2020, but since we weren’t shuttling the child off to another state on Saturday, we took a walk into town to check it out. We didn’t pick up any art this year, [unlike the last time we went in 2019](https://www.builtwith.coffee/blog-posts/2019/06/arts-fest-beverly), but we did get books at the [local book store](https://www.copperdogbooks.com) and jewelry. On the way back we stopped at [Backbeat Brewing Company](https://www.backbeatbrewing.com) which, even though it’s less than half a mile from our house, we hadn’t been to yet. Decent food, impressively good drinks, outdoor patio, A+++ would recommend. Highlight of this year was that we can all walk to town and back now.

### Bunny cupcakes
Lorelei watches this show called [Bread Barbershop](https://www.netflix.com/title/81288010). It’s weird, but this morning the episode she was watching the “barber” made kitty and bunny cupcakes, and rather than the plot being more of, “here’s how you do this as a barber” it was like, a real recipe. I realize that sounds odd if you’ve never seen the show, but stay with me. Lorelei asked if _we_ could do that, and I said yeah, sure, maybe. I had to go to the store anyway. This is what we came up with:

Carrot cake cupcakes, obviously. They’re bunnies.

### Fortnite vs. my free time
I played Fortnite this week for the first time years, and it’s fun. I didn’t get it at first, but I played solo games and got it. And then I realized that the Battle Pass for this season has a dance that’s a ska dance, with a matching ska song about aliens, which feels waaaaaaay more targeted at my generation than who I assumed played Fortnite, so I had to pick it up (pick it up, pick it up… you get it), and then set out to win a few rounds, skanking on the graves of my defeated enemies.

### Bonus: Balancing things on a cat

I’ve had a lot of cats in my life, but Maggie is the best one I’ve ever had for putting up with people putting things on her head.
