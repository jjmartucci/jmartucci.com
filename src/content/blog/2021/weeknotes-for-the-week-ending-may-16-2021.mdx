* First meal from our garden: cucumber and watermelon salad with mint. That might sound impressive, but the only ingredient from the garden was the mint.
* Got a decent bike ride in. One thing from this time last year that I _do_ miss was the reduction in traffic, but I can understand why everyone wanted to be out on a near eighty-degree day in May.

_Being able to ride to the ocean is a thing I will never stop appreciating._

* I’m pretty much back to living my life how I was pre-pandemic, I think, except for wearing a mask indoors. I [went into Boston](https://www.builtwith.coffee/blog-posts/2021/05/meatspace), ran errands this weekend, went to the mall, which, was hard to get me in to _ever_.
* Been messing around with [Groovebox](https://ampifymusic.com/groovebox/) and [Blocs Wave](https://ampifymusic.com/blocswave/) by Ampify Music, I really love the way they’ve designed these apps, they’re the only music creation apps that I could quickly come to terms with. Hope to have something tangible from it soon.
* I’m back to logging my day in [Bear](https://bear.app). It’s nice to just have it open wherever and throw things I think of or what I’m doing in it. Sometimes I even talk to it on my watch.
