description: I don’t follow the Red Sox nearly as closely as I used to, but I at least knew today was opening day.  Or, was supposed to be, I saw it was cancelled. The last time I was at Fenway for opening day was 2009, and the weather was about the same, low 40s and rain / something that looks like snow but lands as rain. It was the middle of three events at Fenway that were each so miserably cold that I gave up on going for at least five years.

In a completely unrelated mental thread I referenced [Adium](https://adium.im) today, and remembered that for a long time I had the [Red Sox Adium duck](https://www.adiumxtras.com/index.php?a=xtras&xtra_id=1052) in my dock, which made me wistful for a bunch of things, but maybe more non-square dock icons than anything.
