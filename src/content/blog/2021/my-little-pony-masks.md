From [My Little Pony - Friends Forever #21](../images/2021/my-little-pony.jpeg) from… October of 2015. Also worth noting when the find the cure, no one (not even Applejack) makes a fuss about how they can’t be forced to take it.

Which reminded me we watched [Six Degrees of Separation](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108149/) last week, and there’s a scene where Will Smith’s character talks about how his father (who he pretends is Sidney Poitier) is going to make a movie version of _Cats_.

History repeating, and what not.
