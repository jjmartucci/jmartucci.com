* Finished [Think Again](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781984878106). If you want the TL;DR version, watch this:

* Kiddo turned 6. I feel like she turned 5 a few months ago? What happened to this last year. That said, my parents came up to visit this weekend because, unlike last year, they can. Big hit among the presents across all of the age ranges was [Ribbon Ninja](https://www.fatbraintoys.com/toy_companies/fat_brain_toy_co/ribbon_ninja.cfm).
* My father was up before anyone else this morning. In fact he was up early enough to discover that the bird feeder in the backyard isn’t getting cleaned out by squirrels, but by a raccoon. Later a hawk started eating from it. I think fencing in our backyard inadvertently turned it into a low-key nature preserve.
* I might not be good at video games any more. I picked up [Returnal](https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-PPSA01284_00-RETURNALGAME0001) on release day, I just beat the first boss this week, and proceeded to get absolutely destroyed in the second level. I just don’t think I can. I also picked up [Cadence of Hyrule](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/cadence-of-hyrule-crypt-of-the-necrodancer-featuring-the-legend-of-zelda-switch/) and also could not, so I finally settled on [Ori and the Will of the Wisps](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps-switch/) which is beautiful and seems beat-able. Ori and the Blind Forest is one of my favorite games of all time and so far it looks like WotW matches it. Also picked up [New Pokémon Snap](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/new-pokemon-snap-switch/) but that was for the aformentioned now six year old.
