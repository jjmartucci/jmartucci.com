- Watching more TV than usual around here. Went through the entire first season of [Sweet Tooth](https://www.netflix.com/title/81221380), and now I have to go back and read the comics. I remember the end of the world events being more vague in the comics, they’ve added detail to the TV series but I’m not sure the details make logical sense. Still, I adored the comics, and the first season does a pretty delightful job of bringing it to life (Bobby is…much cuter). Also watched [Bo Burnham: Inside](https://www.netflix.com/title/81289483), also good. If you want to be convinced to watch it, just watch _Welcome to the Internet_ here:

- Read [Nothing To See Here](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780062913463). It’s about raising kids who spontaneously combust, which, if you’re a parent, you can immediately recognize is really just all kids. The book included this article at the end, which resonated with me: [I Was Worried My Anxiety Would Prevent Me From Being a Good Father. My Sons Changed That](https://time.com/5712486/parenting-with-anxiety/)
- Finished [Ori and the Will of the Wisps](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps-switch/). Great game, one of the few games out there where your character’s movements make you feel super powerful (Spiderman on the PS4 is another one that comes to mind). I wish the Switch Pro controller had a headphone jack because _Ori_ has beautiful music but I had it on low volume since I was playing after the kid was asleep.
- More yard work. This was the end of last weekend:

This is where we are after this weekend:

It’s so close! And by close I mean many tons of pea gravel away from close!
