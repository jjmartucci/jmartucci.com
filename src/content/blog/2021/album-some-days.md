It was getting a little noisy around here, so I made some changes. [An Album a Day](https://www.builtwith.coffee/album-a-day) posts won’t show up individually on the home page or in the RSS feed any more, I’d rather do more of a weekly recap post. Also I switched the [blog feed](https://www.builtwith.coffee/blog/1) to have titles and (if they exist) descriptions with a read more link, not the full post. I was looking for something I wrote the other day and had a hard time finding it which is not great!
