This week, summed up in two short scenes with my daughter.

### Reading is fundamental
_Scene: Local restaurant, on the outdoor patio. A rare family dinner outside the house because the grandparents were visiting before they set off on a cross-country train ride._

<span role="image" aria-label="Me">ğŸ‘¨</span>: What do you want to eat here?<br />
<span role="image" aria-label="Daughter">ğŸ‘§</span>: Hot dog!<br />
<span role="image" aria-label="Me">ğŸ‘¨</span>: Are hot dogs on the menu?<br />
<span role="image" aria-label="Daughter">ğŸ‘§</span>: I dunno?<br />
<span role="image" aria-label="Me">ğŸ‘¨</span>: Read the menu and see if you can find hot dogs.<br />
<span role="image" aria-label="Daughter">ğŸ‘§</span>: I canâ€™t read!<br />
<span role="image" aria-label="Me">ğŸ‘¨</span>: Yes you can, look at the menu and pick out something.<br />
<span role="image" aria-label="Daughter">ğŸ‘§</span>: Pizza! Ice cream! Waffles!<br />

_Later, outside after dusk. My father and daughter are talking about stars in the sky._

<span role="image" aria-label="Daughter">ğŸ‘§</span>: Can I see your phone, I want to know what star that is.<br />
<span role="image" aria-label="Me">ğŸ‘¨</span>: _Opens [Sky Guide](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sky-guide/id576588894), hands over phone._<br />
<span role="image" aria-label="Daughter">ğŸ‘§</span>: Oh, itâ€™s Jupiter.<br />
<span role="image" aria-label="Me">ğŸ‘¨</span>: How do you know?<br />
<span role="image" aria-label="Daughter">ğŸ‘§</span>: _Points at screen._ Ju-pi-ter. It says Jupiter.<br />
<span role="image" aria-label="Me">ğŸ‘¨</span>: _Picks up daughter by shoulders, turns her 45 degrees._<br />
<span role="image" aria-label="Me">ğŸ‘¨</span>: What about that one over there?<br />
<span role="image" aria-label="Daughter">ğŸ‘§</span>: Venus!<br />
<span role="image" aria-label="Me">ğŸ‘¨</span>: So you... can read?<br />
<span role="image" aria-label="Daughter">ğŸ‘§</span>: Noooooooooooooooo

### <span role="image" aria-label="shark">ğŸ¦ˆ</span>

_Scene: at [Stage Fort Park](https://essexheritage.org/attractions/stage-fort-park-gloucester-visitor-center), down on the "boardwalk" looking at the ocean._

<span role="image" aria-label="Daughter">ğŸ‘§</span>: Look, a shark!<br />
<span role="image" aria-label="Me">ğŸ‘¨</span>: I donâ€™t think there are sharks here.<br />
<span role="image" aria-label="Daughter">ğŸ‘§</span>: Itâ€™s right there!<br />
<span role="image" aria-label="Me">ğŸ‘¨</span>: Itâ€™s probably just a roâ€¦ oh it is a shark.<br />

### etc
- Iâ€™ve used [Magnet](https://magnet.crowdcafe.com) for window management on MacOS for a long time, but it turns out thereâ€™s a free option called [Rectangle](https://github.com/rxhanson/Rectangle) that works just as well, and you can install it via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh), which is extra great because I have zero interest in using Mac App store apps on my work Mac.
- I went too long before getting my coffee this morning (we picked up breakfast on the car ride over to aforementioned shark park), and the coffee was weak compared to what I make at home. Took a while to recover. Maybe I should have gotten `onlyfunctionalwith.coffee` instead.
