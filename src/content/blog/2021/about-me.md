I’ve been lazy about putting a new about page on this site, because I wanted to make it look better than the plain text wall I had in the last design. I decided since I’m sitting at my home desk _almost always_ these days, I’d make an interactive version for you to play along with.

So check it out, [a new about page](/about). It’s SVGs, HTML, CSS, and 3 teeny tiny JPEGs. The bigger your monitor, the more you can see. If you figure out how to get yourself on one of the screens, let me know.
