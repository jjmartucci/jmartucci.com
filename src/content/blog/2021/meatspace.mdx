I went to the office yesterday, and then went out with people I only knew through video chat for food at a restaurant. Wild times.

[Massachusetts reported zero COVID-19 deaths yesterday too](https://www.wwlp.com/news/health/coronavirus-local-impact/massachusetts-covid-19-dashboard-no-new-deaths-472-new-cases/). I’m not one to jump to “it's all over” now, and as of right now my next visit to the office is scheduled for 2022, but I will take some joy in things moving in the right direction instead of only the wrong one.
