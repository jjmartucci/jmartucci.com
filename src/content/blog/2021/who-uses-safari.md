description: I’ve saved this screenshot for the next time I need to have a debate about dropping older browser support. It’s from My PlayStation, and the browser is Safari (desktop and mobile!). Literally no way to view your account on an iOS device without downloading the app. Some light Google-ing says there’s over 100 million people with Playstation accounts so it’s unlikely I’m the only person annoyed by this.

I’ve saved this screenshot for the next time I need to have a debate about dropping older browser support. It’s from [My PlayStation](https://my.playstation.com), and the browser is Safari (desktop and mobile!). Literally no way to view your account on an iOS device without downloading the app. Some light Google-ing says there’s over 100 million people with Playstation accounts so it’s unlikely I’m the only person annoyed by this.
