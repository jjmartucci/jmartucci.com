### Ship it!

Big release at work this week; it all went well, and our application is much more accessible now, so it feels pretty good! Remember if you ever need an on demand video or text consultation with a veterinarian, [Connect With a Vet](https://www.chewy.com/app/content/connect-with-a-vet)!

### RTFM (if it exists)
Three only slightly related thoughts, that mean something to me because I used to write technical instruction manuals for a living.
1. I installed a blower fan in our gas fireplace this weekend. The description online said it was “pre-wired” and all you had to do was plug it in, but the comments said no, there was more. Some research showed there are three main ways gas fireplace wiring is found: a junction box with cables in it, a junction specifically wired for gas fireplaces (we had this, more later), or just a normal power outlet. The “pre-wired” bit made sense for the normally wired power outlet, but the junction box in our fireplace had a fan outlet which didn’t have power unless two leads were getting a signal from a thermocouple, so the fan only has power when the fireplace is hot. But again, this unit was “pre-wired” so the thermocouple controlled the unit _assuming it had power_. Anyway, the diagrams included were not helpful, the comments online were not helpful, in the end after pulling some wires apart and realizing that was dumb, I also realized the outlet under our fireplace also had a plug labeled “REM/AUX” which has... always on power. So all I had to do was plug it into that.
2. For a while I’ve thought it would be nice to associate notes with workouts that are recorded by my watch and saved in Apple Fitness. I’ve had some hacky solutions like sharing the work out to my notes app and adding content there, but I realized this weekend that [HealthFit](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/healthfit/id1202650514) the app that I’ve been using _for years_ to sync my Apple workout bike rides to Strava... has a notes field.
3. I got a physical copy of [Metroid Dread](https://metroid.nintendo.com)[^1] this week. Whenever I open a physical game I expect there to be something inside, but there was nothing but the game. Instead someone had to design and code the first (at least) 30 minutes of the game explaining things to the player, instead of just giving them those details in a book along with the game. I’ve played literally every Metroid, I’m just here to shoot blobby aliens and turn into a ball, let me at it!

### etc
- I said last week it’s spooky season, it’s actually puzzle season. Finished two this week.

- I’m trying out [Craft](https://www.craft.do) as a replacement for Bear (at home). I do love Bear but I also have a ton of notes that could use lightweight table markup, or rollups, or just putting two things side-by-side, or a quick preview of a PDF... the list goes on. Bear was a replacement for Notion for me, after Notion got too annoying to use offline. Craft borrows (or, steals) a lot from Notion, but it’s a Mac Catalyst app and it works offline, and you can even BYOS (bring your own storage) and save your content in iCloud instead of their cloud[^2].

[^1]: I don’t invest in cryptocurrency but I _do_ invest in physical copies of Nintendo games. I think I’ve picked the right horse, assuming the course is a few million miles long.
[^2]: It’s worth noting since I’m comparing the two that Bear already uses iCloud. It’s also worth noting that Craft has an entire [support page](https://support.craft.do/hc/en-us/articles/360019706978-iCloud-Troubleshooting-for-External-Storage) on dealing with iCloud because while it’s stable and secure, there’s also a good reason almost every other app has rolled their own cloud storage solution.
