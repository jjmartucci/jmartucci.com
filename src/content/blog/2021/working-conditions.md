I‚Äôve always been an office employee, and over time I‚Äôve seen almost every combination of working schedules. My ranked list:

1. 2 days in office, 3 days at home.
2. 3 days in office, 2 days at home.
3. 5 days at home.
4. 4 days in office, 1 day at home.
5. 4 days, 10 hours, all in office.
6. 5 days, 8 hours, all in office.

This order has a few caveats: I have almost always had a ‚Äúlong‚Äù commute (it‚Äôs likely average by American standards but it‚Äôs long _to me_). 1-3 are pretty arbitrarily arranged and mostly based on the jobs I had those schedules at and how often other people were in the office. If 4x10 became 4x8 it would probably immediately jump to the #1 spot ‚Äî there‚Äôs no substitute for an entire day back to yourself, but 10 hours of knowledge work is too much to expect from a brain on any given day.

4x8 versus 4x10 and the pandemic schedules which tended to drift into ‚Äúnever in the office but always available‚Äù brings up a lot of other questions about availability of time versus actionable time. There were [dedicated marketing campaigns](https://medium.com/signal-v-noise/microsoft-reboots-war-on-sleep-a90da0396fb5) for 24/7 office work pre-pandemic, and I don‚Äôt think anything has gotten better in that regard.

One of the most important lessons I learned in my working career was from my first job. I was a contractor but I worked with a bunch of [IAM](https://www.goiam.org) machinists, and at shift change, down to the exact minute, they‚Äôd be pushing the doors open and running for their cars. Granted, they couldn‚Äôt take their work home ‚Äî some of them worked with tools the size of small house, but that mentality of ‚Äúthe work day is done‚Äù has stuck with me.
