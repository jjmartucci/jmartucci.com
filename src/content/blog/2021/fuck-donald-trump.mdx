Days after, or even the day of the 2017 inauguration, I was in North Station and someone was singing just the chorus of “FDT” over and over.

That’s been in my head _a lot_ for the last four years. I’m not sure it will ever leave, but maybe the mental play count drops a bit after today.

I’m still a tiny bit optimistic that four years of fuckery has engaged a lot of people in the Democratic process who weren’t before. I’m very, very, slightly hopeful that people finding channels outside of main stream media eventually swings towards hearing unheard voices, not amplifying the loudest and worst. If I can be glad for one little thing today, it’s seeing the President wearing a mask, because this never needed to be as difficult as it is.
