- We had a writer in residence this week, so while my wife was off doing [cool and fun things](https://www.copperdogbooks.com/event/virtual-event-jodie-slaughter) I was going full Dad with my daughter, enjoying a couple of pints of ice cream and crushing levels in a [new video game](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/moving-out-switch/)[^1]. I consider this slightly more appropriate than what my dad used to do with me when my mom was out, which was watching 80s action movies on HBO.
- One night the ice cream was accompanied by crying. When I asked Lorelei why she was upset (seemingly out of nowhere) she said she was sad because if she got older, eventually she would die. It took a bit of back and forth to tease out that these ideas had maybe come from a TV show she likes (_Last Kids on Earth_), but I pointed out that I was much older than her, and still alive, so it was at least not a thing to worry about at the present moment. Certainly it could wait until the ice cream was finished.
- Related, I started reading [_Four Thousand Weeks (Time Management for Mortals)_](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780374159122). The 4,000 weeks comes from the average life expectancy in weeks. Rather than calling this post ‚ÄúWeeknotes for the week ending August 15, 2001‚Äù I could title it ‚ÄúWeek 2038 (out of, hopefully, at least 4000)‚Äù. If you want the TL;CRAWB[^2] Burkeman‚Äôs [last Health & wellbeing column in the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/sep/04/oliver-burkemans-last-column-the-eight-secrets-to-a-fairly-fulfilled-life#comments) covers the highlights.
- I finished [_Rainbow In the Dark_](https://www.builtwith.coffee/books/2021/rainbow-in-the-dark), Ronnie James Dio‚Äôs autobiography. It‚Äôs good, but a bit niche. I didn‚Äôt get into Dio my first go round with metal; I think someone convinced me _Heaven and Hell_ wasn‚Äôt a ‚Äúreal‚Äù Sabbath album (in hindsight, fuck them). It was the [Killswitch Engage cover of _Holy Diver_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR7dG_m3MsI) that made me go look up everything he ever did. ü§òü§òü§ò out of five.
- Our kitchen project is entirely done. I got to put the new vent hood through its paces tonight (grits and collard greens). For someone who cooks multiple times per day, the hood and the huge workspace-style sink are the things I like best. It looks good, but oh baby those functional upgrades.
- Spent a lot of time in the yard this weekend. Saturday I got a good outside nap in, today we went out for a walk early. We spotted a praying mantis in the yard.

It seemed annoyed by us. We also walked to the beach. There‚Äôs a new rule here, if I have to carry home a pocket of seashells, they have to be used for _something_.

[^1]: A very cool thing about _Moving Out_ is that you can can adjust a bunch of properties that affect the game difficulty. So we found a setting where we both feel like we‚Äôre playing the game but it‚Äôs still a little challenging for each of us.
[^2]: Too long; can‚Äôt read a whole book.
