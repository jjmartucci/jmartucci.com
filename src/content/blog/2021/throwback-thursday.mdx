Picked up some more boxes of “stuff”  from my parents house while visiting for Easter. Among the piles, CDs for web browsers for both the Dreamcast and Playstation 2. Funny to think that 20 years ago “going online” was still a thing you had to do on a console, instead of the constant state of modern consoles.

And among a box of floppy disks, one of my early forays into web development! I dumped [this entire floppy here](https://www.builtwith.coffee/floppy/). It says the site was generated by [Arachnophilia](https://arachnoid.com/arachnophilia/index.html) which amazingly still sort of exists. My email address `@earthdome.com` definitely does not!
