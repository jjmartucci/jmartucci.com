> Edison, Albert Einstein, and Salvador Dali all recognized that sleep spurred their creativity, and developed a similar practice to harness it. They would put something heavy in their hand (Edison used steel balls, Dali and Einstein, a key) and sit in a chair. When they grew drowsy and relaxed, they would drop the object and wake up. That’s when they felt like they came up with their biggest creative ideas (and perhaps broken toes).

> Ten minutes of quality, devoted practice yields more than an hour of distracted efforts
