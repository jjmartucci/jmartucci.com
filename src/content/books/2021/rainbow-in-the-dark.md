Things I learned from reading this book:

* Connecticut at one point had no state income tax.
* Driving long distances in the 60s was _terrifying_.
* I knew Dio was successful, but I didn't realize how successful Elf and Rainbow was, and that _Heaven and Hell_ is the best selling Sabbath album.
* As far as 80s rock/metal musicians Dio was incredibly tame. Maybe I should read _the Dirt_ next.
