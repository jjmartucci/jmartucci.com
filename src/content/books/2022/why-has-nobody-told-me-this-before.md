Chapter 10: Make it All Go Away!
This is why the heart palpitations brought on by too many cups of coffee can culminate in a panic attack. The pounding heart, faster breathing and sweaty palms all feel a bit familiar to that time you had a panic attack in the supermarket.

Given that what you feel is not a factual statement, neither are thoughts. That is partly why therapies like CBT (Cognitive Behavrioal Therapy) can be so helpful to many people. It gives us practice at being able to step back from thoughts and feelings and see them for what they are — just one possible perspective.

## Chapter 11: what to do with emotions
When you feel something, give it a name. Learn lots of names for lots of emotions. We don’t only feel happy, sad, fearful or angry. We feel vulnerable and ashamed, bitter and grateful, inadequate and excited. 
In therapy a lot of work is put into this. Notice what you feel, notice where you feel it in your body, and label it.

Self-soothing box: when you are in emotional pain, at the height of your distress, your brain is set up to bypass your problem-solving capabilities. She has a pen and paper in hers, and a note to call a friend.

## Chapter 12: How to harness the power of your words
The Feeling Wheel [[The Feeling Wheel]]

## Chapter 13: How to support someone
Condensed list from the book of things that stood out:
1. Don’t underestimate just being there.
2. If there’s a specific diagnosis, do research on how that affects them.
3. They probably know what they need, listen to them!
4. Your own health matters too. You can’t help others if you can’t help yourself.
5. Get your own support.
6. Set boundaries.
7. Work on a crisis plan.
8. Ask questions that aren’t just “yes” or “no” answers. “What are you thinking?”
9. Listen. Don’t offer advice unless they ask for it.
10. Healing is never smooth or linear.
11. Be honest.

## Chapter 14: Understanding grief
Endings that feel signficant can trigger a grief reaction, even if the ending is not death. 
Grief is normal.

## Chapter 15: The stages of grief
Denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance. Not linear, and acceptance might never be final.

## Chapter 16: The tasks of mourning
Grief takes time. We need to find a way to keep that connection going with the loved one without their physical presence.

## Chapter 17: The pillars of strength
1. Relationship with the person who has died: Visit their grave or a special place.
2. Relationship with the self
3. Expressing grief
4. Time. Setting a time frame only increases the pain.
5. Mind and body: Regular exercise, eating well, maintaining social contact.
6. Limits
7. Structure
8. Focusing: Mindfulness, focus on your feelings.

# ON SELF-DOUBT
## Chapter 18: Dealing with criticism and disapproval
Those who feel socially anxious tend to focus their attention more on how they are being perceived by those around them (Clark & Wells, 1995). But those who feel more confident tend to have a more outward focus of attention, leading with a curiosity for other people.
* Building up the ability to tolerate the criticism that could be helpful and use it to your advantage while maintaining a sense of self-worth.
* Being open to learning from negative feedback that could help you make progress.
* Learning to let go of criticisms that reflect the values of someone else rather than your own.
* Getting clarity on which opinions matter the most to you and why, so that it becomes easier to know when to reflect and learn and when to let go and move on.

Saying ‘I don’t care what anyone thinks’ is rarely true and hides a world of insecurities. It stops us creating meaningful connections with other because it closes off any avenue of communication in which both voices matter.

The one person you most need the approval of is you. When the way we are living is out of line with our values and what matters most, life stops feeling meaningful or satisfying. 

## Chapter 19: The key to building confidence
Confident is not the same as comfortable. One of the biggest misconceptions about becoming self-confident is that it means living fearlessly. The key to building confidence is quit the opposite. It means we are willing to let fear be present as we do the things that matter to us.

The Learning Model (Luckner & Nadler,1991)
![[image 10.png]]

A review of the research by a group of psychologists showed that high self-esteem is not linked with better relationships or better performance. But it does correlate with arrogance, prejudice and discrimination.

… found that when those with low self-esteem were told it is OK to experience negative thoughts, their mood improved. They no longer had to battle with trying to convince themselves of something they didn’t yet believe.

## Chapter 20: You are not your mistakes
## Chapter 21: Being enough
… the reasearch shows us that those who develop self-acceptance and learn to be self-compassionate are less likely to fear failure, more likely to preserve and try again when they do fail and generally have more self-confidence.

> Let’s say that from the moment you closed this book you started living your life with undconditional self-acceptance. What would that look like? What would you do differently? What would you say yes to? What would you say no to? What would you work harder on? What would you let go of? How would you speak to yourself? How would you speak to others?

# On Fear
## Chapter 22: Make anxiety disappear!
Our attempts to control fear and eliminate it become the real problem that dictates our every move. Fear is around every turn, in every novel situation we face, in every creative endeaour and every learning experience. If we are unwilling to experience it, what are we left with?

## Chapter 23: Things we do that make anxiety worse
if you want to feel less anxious about something, do it as often as you can.

Safety behaviors: ease anxiety in the moment but keep us stuck in the long term.
* Escape
* Anxious avoidance - “saying no” doing something that keeps you from having to do the thing that makes you anxious.
* Compensatory strategies
* Anticipation - Thinking about worst-case scenarios over and over.
* Reassurance seeking - Having other tell you “it will be OK”
* Safety behaviors - We may feel unable to go anywhere without “just in case” medications, or we take a mobile phone everywhere because looking down at it enables us to avoid conversation at social events.

## Chapter 24: How to calm anxiety right now
🧘‍♀️ (4 square breathing)

## Chapter 25: What to do with anxious thoughts
Use distanced language. Shift the perspective, or write the thoughts down.

Biases that happen when anxious:
* Catastrophizing. Thinking of the worst outcome of a situation.
* Personalizing. Making a scenario more about yourself than it actually is.
* Mental filter. Focusing on negative points and ignoring positive ones, or one that could change our mindset for the better.
* Overgeneralizing. Take one experience and apply it to every experience.
* Labelling. If you identify as a certain type of person, you will *be* that type of person.

Reframing is when you allow yourself to consider reinterpreting the situation in a way that is going to help you move through it.

… life becomes more rich and full when we make our decisions based on our values and what matters most.

An easy way to do this is to come back to questions such as ‘Why is this so important to me? In a year from now, when I look back on this moment, what action or response would make me proud and grateful? What kind of person do I want to be in this situation? What do I want to stand for?”

What response would make me proud to write in my journal tonight and look back on this time next year?

## Chapter 26: Fear of the inevitable
Those who experience panic attacks commonly misinterpret the pounding heart for a heart attack and the terror of believing that they are about to die triggers a panic attack. 

> It’s not easy to live every moment wholly aware of death. It’s like trying to stare the sun in the face: you can stand only so much of it.

Irvin Yalom *Staring at the Sun*

If we talk about our fear of death, most people respond with an attempt to reduce our fear by challenging the probability that it will happen any time soon. This is often well-intentioned but not helpful, as we all know that it will happen eventuallyt and we all know that it can happen without warning. When we try to avoid the fear of death by making ourselves ffeel safe from it right now, that same fear will inevitably pop up again somewhere else when we are reminded of life’s fragility.

# On Stress
## Chapter 27: Is stress different from anxiety?
Your brain is constantly receiving information from your body about the demands of the outside world and trying to work out how much effort is needed. It tries to match the amount of energy being released in the body to the demands from the outside world, to ensure that nothing is wasted. When our internal physiological state feels well matched to the environment, we mostly interpret that as a positive feeling, even when it involves stress, for example, when you feel pumped and ready for a big sports competition. But when that internal environment is not matched to the demands of the external world, we tend to interpret that as negative. When we are tired but wired and can’t get to sleep. Or when we are so stressed that we can’t seem to focus on the questions in an exam or job interview. 

## Chapter 29: When good stress goes bad
Burnout happens when that short-term stress response that we have is repeatedly triggered over a prolonged period. There is often a chronic mismatch between the individual and one of the following:
1. Control - Living in a situation in which you do not have the resources needed to meet the demands you are faced with.
2. Reward - This might be financial in an employment scenario. But equally, it can be a sense of social recognition or acknowledgement of value, either in a work environment or any other.
3. Community - A lack of positive human interaction and the sense that one has social support or a sense of belonging.
4. Fairness - When there is perceived inequality in any of the other factors in this list. When some people have their needs met more than others or demands fall on some more than others.
5. Values - When the deans you face are in direct conflict with your personal values.

Signs of chronic long-term stress:
* Disturbed sleep on a regular basis.
* Changes in appetite
* More frequent agitation and irritability than may impact on relationships.
* Problems concentrating and focusing on tasks.
* Problems switching off and resting even when exhausted.
* Persistent headaches or dizziness.
* Muscle pain and tension.
* Stomach problems.
* Sexual problems.
* Increased dependence on addictive behaviors such as smoking, drinking, and over-eating.
* Feeling overwhelmed and avoiding small stressors that would normally feel manageable.

## Chapter 30: Making stress work for you
Those who build their life on self-focused goals are more vulnerable to depression, anxiety and loneliness. Whereas those who structure their goals on something bigger than the self tend to feel more hopeful, grateful, inspired, excited and experience better wellbeing and life satisfaction.

Mindfulness, awe.

## Chapter 31: Coping when it counts
Self-compassion is not letting yourself off the hook constantly.

## Chapter 32: The problem with ‘I just want to be happy’
But humans are not built to be in a constant happy state. We are built to respond to the challenges of survival.

When we don’t have clarity on our values, we can set goals based on what we think we should be doing, others’ expectations, or a guess that once we achieve that goal, we will finally be enough, we can finally relax and be happy with who we are. One major flaw with that is it puts rigid parameters around the conditions in which you can be content and happy. It also places life satisfaction and happiness all int eh future (Clear, 2018). 

## Chapter 33: Working out what matters
Rate values 0 - 10. How does this line up with reality?

## Chapter 35: Relationships
Yet we are surrounded by things that tempt us with escape from the vulnerable moments. We numb out with endless social media scrolling or we throw ourselves into work and make ourselves too busy to stop. Or we turn away from our connection in order to obsess over making ourselves better along the lines of what the outside world tells us will do that. We focus on trying to look something closer to perfect, or reach somewhere closer to wealth. Noe of which is what our connection truly needs to make it work.
