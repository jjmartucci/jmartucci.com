title: Powering Search With Astro Actions and Fuse.js | CSS-Tricks
description: With Astro, we can generate most of our site during our build, but have a small bit of server-side code that can handle search functionality using something like Fuse.js. In this demo, we’ll use Fuse to search through a set of personal “bookmarks” that are generated at build time, but return back proper results from a server call.
