# AI Programming Tools

Notes on AI tools and techniques to aide with programming tasks.

## Currently Using

[Aider - AI Pair Programming in Your Terminal](https://aider.chat). I really like this for quickly getting scripts and glue code off the ground. It’s what I used to generate the Bear2Astro script I mentioned in [The Constant Gardener](/garden/plant/the-constant-gardener) using [Claude with API credits](https://console.anthropic.com/login).

## Tried but not currently using

[Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/). I don’t entirely buy into the entire IDE replacement idea.

## Noted but not used
