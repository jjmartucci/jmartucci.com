This is a top-level page of hardware and software I use on a regular basis.
## Software
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). I've gone back and forth on note taking apps many times but currently I use . One of my major gripes with Obsidian is the reliance on plugins, so I don't use many:
	- [AnuPpuccin theme](https://github.com/AnubisNekhet/AnuPpuccin)
	- [Calendar](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=calendar)
	- [Dataview](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=dataview)
	- [Iconic](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=iconic)
	- [Style Settings](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian-style-settings)
	- [Tasks](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian-tasks-plugin)
	- [Smart Typography](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-smart-typography/issues) because I needs the “curly quotes”
	- [Emoji Shortcodes](obsidian://show-plugin?id=emoji-shortcodes)
- [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), although for projects I tend to use WebStorm more these days. I think the UI and tooling out of the box is better than VS Code which relies on plugins.
- Safari for a web browser. I have _all_ of them installed somewhere, but I highly value consistency between my devices, so Safari is really the only choice here, although I’d probably still chose it if the iPhone had other options. The only plugins I use are:
	- [Kagi for Safari](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/kagi-for-safari/id1622835804) to redirect searches to Kagi.
	- [1Blocker](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/kagi-for-safari/id1622835804) for ad blocking.
- [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com) for quick lookups and launching things. I've gone back and forth between Alfred and [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com), in general I prefer Alfred's ”leave me alone“ style of UI.
- [Affinity Designer 2 and Affinity Photo 2](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/) for photo editing and SVGs.
- [Dato](https://sindresorhus.com/dato). Helpful way to keep your calendar in the taskbar without the overhead of something like Fantastical.
- [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer) for working on longer writing pieces.
- [CleanShot X](https://cleanshot.com) for screenshots.
- [Paprika Recipe Manager 3](https://www.paprikaapp.com) for organizing recipes.
- [Sleeve 2](https://replay.software/sleeve) for showing the currently playing song from Apple Music on my desktop.
- [Things 3](https://culturedcode.com/things/) for “tasks”, and Apple Reminders for reminders.
- [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io) mostly for moving files around S3 storage.
- [DaisyDisk](https://daisydiskapp.com) for managing Mac harddrive space.
- [Copilot](https://copilot.money) for keeping track of money. This is not the Microsoft Copilot, and I feel a little bad for them having to be stuck with this name because it’s nigh impossible to search for.
- [Reeder](https://reederapp.com) for keeping track of RSS feeds.
## Homeserver
I keep a separate note on [my homeserver setup here](homeserver.md).
## Networking
My current setup is an [Arris S33 modem](https://www.surfboard.com/products/cable-modems/s33/) into a [Unifi Cloud Gateway Ultra](https://techspecs.ui.com/unifi/cloud-gateways/ucg-ultra?s=us) as a router into eero 6s for the access point / mesh network. This is mostly because the Unifi software gives you more control over DNS, so I can have all the homeserver apps resolve locally, and have all the network DNS go through [NextDNS](https://nextdns.io).

Some of the house has been hardwired by switching the old CAT5e phone lines with ethernet jacks. For the rooms that didn’t have phone drops I used [MoCA adapters](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08ML1TSXC?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_1&th=1) on the cable drops. Either of these gets a reliable 1Gbps output.
## Hardware
- An M1 MacBook Air with 16GB of RAM.
- An older [GMMK](https://www.gloriousgaming.com) keyboard with [Kailh Box Black switches](https://www.kailh.net/products/kailh-box-switch-set) and [Ducky Purple/White Pudding keycaps](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/products/ducky-purple-white-pudding-87-key-oem-profile-double-shot-pbt-keycap-set?_pos=3&_sid=c042a18a9&_ss=r). I went with those switches because I tend to hammer on keyboards.
- A [Logitech G305 mouse](https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/products/gaming-mice/g305-lightspeed-wireless-gaming-mouse.910-006020.html) in purple to match the key caps.
- A [Dell G3223Q](https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-32-4k-uhd-gaming-monitor-g3223q/apd/210-bdbk/monitors-monitor-accessories) monitor.
- [CalDigit TS3](https://www.caldigit.com/ts3-plus/) dock. Good, although it won't work as a USB-C hub, so I have a [twelvesouth StayGo USB-C Hub](https://www.twelvesouth.com/products/staygo-usb-c-hub) and some small Anker USB-C hubs for travel.
- An M2 iPad Pro, mostly used for book reading and making music.
## Fun Tech
- Our TV is an [LG C1 Oled](https://www.lg.com/us/tvs/lg-oled65c1pub-oled-4k-tv) hooked up to a [SONOS Arc](https://www.sonos.com/en-us/shop/arc) with [Ikea Symfonisks](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/symfonisk-sonos-wifi-bookshelf-speaker-black-smart-gen-2-20506584/) as surrounds.
- PS5 and Steam Deck for gaming. If I want
