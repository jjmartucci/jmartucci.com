Clicky clacky things.
## Interesting Keyboards
[Keychron K2 HE Wireless Magnetic Switch Custom Keyboard](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k2-he-wireless-magnetic-switch-keyboard) - hall effect magnetic switches, nice wood finish.  
[C68 Cat 65% Wireless Mechanical Keyboard](https://kineticlabs.com/keyboards/yunzii/yunzii-c68-keyboard) - It uh, has a cat on it.
## iPad Keyboards
I have the [Logitech Combo Folio](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/shop/p/combo-touch-ipad.920-011433) on my iPad Pro. It’s light and relatively unobtrusive compared to some of the other iPad keyboard designs. The typing experience is… ok. Also it’s made of a cloth like surface, and since I use the iPad while cooking often, it’s covered in a lot of stains.
