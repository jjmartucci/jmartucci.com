# Guitar Pedals

Notes on guitar pedals, brands, settings, etc.

## Currently on the board

In order from guitar to monitors.

1.  Walrus Audio Canvas Tuner
2.  [Tsakalis Experience](https://tsakalisaudioworks.com/product/experience/) fuzz / ocatve
3.  [KATZENKÖNIG](https://catalinbread.com/products/katzenkonig)
4.  JHS 3 series phaser
5.  Keeley Super Phat mod
6.  [UAFX Brigade](https://www.uaudio.com/products/brigade-chorus-vibrato)
7.  [Walrus Audio Monument harmonic tremolo](https://www.walrusaudio.com/products/monument-harmonic-tap-tremolo-v2?variant=13647185051694)
8.  [Line 6 Pod Express](https://line6.com/podexpress/?locale=en_US). I really only use the “Dynamic” amp on this, which in the Helix software is the Cartographer.
9.  JHS Lucky Cat delay
10.  Fender Marine Layer Reverb

## Pedals I'd like to try

[Old Blood Noise Endeavors Visitor](https://oldbloodnoise.com/pedals/p/visitor-parallel-multi-modulator)  
[Keeley Octa Psi Transfigurating Fuzz](https://reverb.com/p/keeley-octa-psi-transfigurating-fuzz)  
[Walrus Audio Eons Five-State Fuzz](https://reverb.com/p/walrus-audio-eons-five-state-fuzz)

## Previously Owned Pedals

[Danelectro Cool Cat Chorus](https://reverb.com/p/danelectro-cool-cat-chorus). Lush and stereo out, although with 18v. Maybe should have kept this one.  
[Ibanez TS9DX Turbo Tube Screamer 1998 - Present](https://reverb.com/p/ibanez-ts-9dx-1998-present). TS9 mode was ok, everything above that was awful sounding.  
[Vox V847 Wah 1994 - 2006](https://reverb.com/p/vox-v847-wah-1994-2006). Goes wah, wah. _Played Burning of the Midnight Lamp_ with it a bunch.
