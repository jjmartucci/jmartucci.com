# Fish Taco Topping

Quick mix for topping fish tacos.

## Ingredients

*   12 ounces of shredded red cabbage
*   1/3 cup red onions
*   2/3 cup of low-fat sour cream or low/no-fat Greek yogurt
*   1 mango, diced
*   1 avocado, diced
*   1/4 cup Cotija cheese.
*   Juice from 1 lime (or bottled equivalent)
*   2 tsp sea salt
*   ~2 tbsp Cholula, to taste.

## Directions

Mix everything together. Tastes better if you let it sit for a few hours before using it. Serve on top of your fish of choice on top of warm corn tortillas. For a quick meal I use pre-marinated / seasoned fish and mix this together while the fish is in the air fryer.

## Notes

I use the Sweet Habanero Cholula, the Tequila & Lime flavor is a good option too.
