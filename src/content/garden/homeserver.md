# Homeserver

Notes on setting up a Homeserver. I wrote about my build here: [The Big Dumb Box of Computer Parts: Linux Edition](/garden/plant/the-big-dumb-box-of-computer-parts-linux-edition).

## Music

I used [dbPoweramp](https://www.dbpoweramp.com) to rip CDs. One issue I ran into was solved by this thread: [https://forum.dbpoweramp.com/forum/dbpoweramp/cd-ripper/38208-rip-error-over-and-over-again](https://forum.dbpoweramp.com/forum/dbpoweramp/cd-ripper/38208-rip-error-over-and-over-again)

## Installed Apps

*   krusader
*   Glance
*   Glances
*   homepage
*   kavita
*   lidarr
*   nginx-proxy-manager
*   overseerr
*   plex
*   prowlarr
*   radarr
*   romm
*   sabnzbd
*   sonarr
*   syncthing
*   [metube: Self-hosted YouTube downloader](https://github.com/alexta69/metube)

## Installed but gave up on

*   [Paperless](https://github.com/paperless-ngx/paperless-ngx).
*   [Shiori](https://github.com/go-shiori/shiori). App works nicely (outside of having some issues running behind nginx proxy manager) but I’ve found I just don’t save bookmarks like this.
*   [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com). Very, very janky UI. Use [calibre-web](https://github.com/janeczku/calibre-web) if you want/have a Calibre db.

## Apps of Note

Stuff I have seen while researching homeserver ideas but not yet installed or used.

*   [Vikunja](https://vikunja.io). Project and todo list management.
