# Creamy, Light Macaroni and Cheese

![](/garden/image.jpeg)  
You might initially recoil at the butternut squash but this is my favorite Mac & Cheese for the colder months. Originally from [Creamy, Light Macaroni and Cheese Recipe | Cooking Light](https://www.cookinglight.com/recipes/creamy-light-macaroni-cheese).

## Ingredients

  

*   3 cups cubed peeled butternut squash (about 1 \[1-pound\] squash)
*   1 1/4 cups fat-free, lower-sodium chicken broth
*   1 1/2 cups fat-free milk
*   2 garlic cloves, peeled
*   2 tablespoons plain fat-free Greek yogurt
*   1 teaspoon kosher salt
*   1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
*   1 1/4 cups (5 ounces) shredded Gruyère cheese
*   1 cup (4 ounces) grated pecorino Romano cheese
*   1/4 cup (1 ounce) finely grated fresh Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, divided
*   1 pound uncooked cavatappi
*   Cooking spray
*   1 teaspoon olive oil
*   1/2 cup panko (Japanese breadcrumbs)
*   2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley

## Directions

1.  Preheat oven to 375°.
2.  Combine squash, broth, milk, and garlic in a medium saucepan; bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium, and simmer until squash is tender when pierced with a fork, about 25 minutes. Remove from heat.
3.  Place the hot squash mixture in a blender. Add salt, pepper, and Greek yogurt. Remove the center piece of blender lid (to allow steam to escape); secure blender lid on blender. Place a clean towel over opening in blender lid (to avoid splatters). Blend until smooth. Place blended squash mixture in a bowl; stir in Gruyère, pecorino Romano, and 2 tablespoons Parmigiano-Reggiano. Stir until combined.
4.  Cook pasta according to package directions, omitting salt and fat; drain well. Add pasta to squash mixture, and stir until combined. Spread mixture evenly into a 13 x 9-inch glass or ceramic baking dish coated with cooking spray.
5.  Heat oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add panko, and cook for 2 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from heat; stir in remaining 2 tablespoons Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. Sprinkle evenly over the hot pasta mixture. Lightly coat topping with cooking spray.
6.  Bake at 375° for 25 minutes or until bubbly. Sprinkle with parsley, and serve immediately.
