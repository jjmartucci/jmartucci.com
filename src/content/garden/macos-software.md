# MacOS Software

Notes on MacOS (and iOS and iPadOS) software.

## Frequently used apps

*   [Bear](https://bear.app/)
*   [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/)
*   Safari with
    *   [Kagi](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/kagi-for-safari/id1622835804)
    *   [1Blocker](https://1blocker.com/)
*   [CleanshotX](https://cleanshot.com/)
*   [Dato](https://sindresorhus.com/dato). A nice compromise between the functionality of the default Mac Calendar and [Fantastical](https://flexibits.com/fantastical).
*   [Freeform](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/freeform/id6443742539). It’s been a while since a piece of default software on MacOS has been really impressive but as far as whiteboarding apps go Freeform is pretty good.
*   [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/). Or [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/). You’d think I’d pick just one by now but no, no I haven’t.
*   [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) and [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/). I generally prefer WebStorm for “projects” and VSCode for quickly editing something.
*   [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/)
