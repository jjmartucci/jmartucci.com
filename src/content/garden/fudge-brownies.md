# Fudge Brownies

I found this recipe when looking for a brownie recipe that required no whole chocolate as we had run out -- but always have cocoa powder around.

## Ingredients

*   5¼ oz butter
*   1¼ cups plain (all purpose) flour
*   2 oz cocoa 
*   2 medium eggs
*   1½ cups soft brown sugar (light or dark – whichever you prefer – see Note 2)

## Directions

1.  Melt the butter in a small saucepan over a gentle heat. As soon as the butter is melted, take the pan off the heat and allow to cool – do not allow it to bubble.
2.  Preheat your oven to 180C / 160C fan / gas mark 4 / 350F.
3.  Grease and line a 23 x 23cm (9 x 9 inch) brownie pan.
4.  Combine the flour and cocoa in a large bowl.
5.  Crack the two eggs into a jug (or another bowl) and whisk lightly.
6.  Add the sugar to the eggs, and whisk lightly to combine the eggs and the sugar.
7.  Add the cooled melted butter to the egg and sugar mixture and whisk lightly to combine all the wet ingredients.
8.  Pour the egg/sugar/butter mixture into the flour/cocoa mixture and gently stir together until just combined.
9.  Tip the brownie batter into the prepared tray, spread the batter out to the corners and smooth the top.
10.  Place in your preheated oven for 20-25 minutes depending on how gooey you like your brownies in the middle.
11.  Remove from the oven and leave to cool in the tin – until cool enough to handle – then lift out and chop into 16 squares.

## Notes

The original recipe called for 30 - 90 grams of cocoa, I personally go with something closer to the 90 end.
